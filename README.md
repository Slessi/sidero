# Sidero

The repository is split into two folders for the backend and frontend.
Refer to the respective readmes for running each app:

- [fe-test-service/README.md](fe-test-service/README.md)
- [fe-web-app/README.md](fe-web-app/README.md)

## The Task

Implement a simple web app using Vue JS preferrably, which will load the logs and render them efficiently on the page.
It should also support a live search of the logs.

The frontend project can be created in the same repo to simplify things.
